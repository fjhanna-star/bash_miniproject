## Project Description
This project analyzes genomic scaffold data and protein database records using bash command-line tools. The analysis includes:
- Counting and filtering DNA sequences from FASTA files
- Calculating sequence statistics (length, coverage)
- Extracting and analyzing protein information from database files
- Automating bioinformatics workflows with bash scripts

## Requirements

### Software
- Bash shell (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)
- Git and GitHub account
- Basic Unix tools: `grep`, `awk`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`

### Data Files
The `Data/` directory contains:
1. **IP-004_S38_L001_scaffolds.fasta** (~10 MB) - Genomic scaffolds from sequencing assembly
2. **humchrx.txt** (~152 KB) - UniProt protein entries for human chromosome X

## Usage Instructions

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
   cd bash_miniproject
   ```

2. Verify data files are present:
   ```bash
   ls -lh Data/
   ```

### Running the Scripts

[TODO: Add instructions for each script as you create them. Example format below:]

#### Script 1: Extract Headers
```bash
./scripts/extract_headers.sh
```

#### Script 2: Filter by Length
```bash
./scripts/filter_by_length.sh 5000
```
**Purpose**: [TODO: Describe what this script does]
**Output**: [TODO: Describe the output file(s)]

[TODO: Continue adding instructions for all your scripts]

### Running the Master Script
```bash
./scripts/run_analysis.sh ./Data/
```
**Purpose**: [TODO: Describe what the master script does]
**Output**: [TODO: Describe all output files generated]
